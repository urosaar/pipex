The < symbol takes a file’s content and sends it as input to a command.
Instead of typing input manually, the command reads from the file.


The | takes the output of one command and sends it as input to another command.
This lets us combine multiple commands without using files.

The > symbol redirects the command output to a file instead of printing it on the screen.
If the file already exists, it is cleared before writing.


The >> symbol appends output to the end of a file instead of replacing it.


The << LIMITER allows you to type input manually until you enter LIMITER.
Useful for interactive input.
